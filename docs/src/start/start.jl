# # Quick start

# This quick start guide introduces the main features of Coluna through the example of the
# Generalized Assignment Problem.

# ## Problem

# Consider a set of machines `M = 1:nb_machines` and a set of jobs `J = 1:nb_jobs`.
# A machine $m$ has a resource capacity $Q_m$ .
# A job $j$ assigned to a machine $m$ has a cost $c_{mj}$ and consumes $w_{mj}$ resource units
# of the machine $m$.
# The goal is to minimize the sum of job costs while assigning each job to a machine and not
# exceeding the capacity of each machine.

# Let $x_{mj}$ equal to one if job $j$ is assigned to machine $m$; $0$ otherwise.
# The problem has the original formulation:

# ```math
# \begin{alignedat}{4}
# \text{[GAP]} \equiv \min \mathrlap{\sum_{m \in M}\sum_{j \in J} c_{mj} x_{mj}}  \\
# \text{s.t.} && \sum_{m \in M} x_{mj} &= 1  \quad& j \in J \\
# && \sum_{j \in J} w_{mj} x_{mj} &\leq Q_m Â \quad  \quad& m \in M  \\
# && x_{mj}  &\in \{0,1\}  &m \in M,\; j \in J
# \end{alignedat}
# ```

# In this tutorial, you will solve the instance below using a "simple" branch-and-cut-and-price
# algorithm:

# This model has a block structure: each knapsack constraint defines
# an independent block and the set-partitioning constraints couple these independent
# blocks. By applying the Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation, each knapsack constraint forms
# a tractable subproblem and the set-partitioning constraints are handled in a master problem.

# To introduce the model, you need to load packages JuMP and BlockDecomposition. To optimize
# the problem, you need Coluna and a Julia package that provides a MIP solver such as HiGHS.


using JuMP, BlockDecomposition, Coluna, HiGHS;


# Next, you instantiate the solver and define the algorithm that you use to optimize the problem.
# In this case, the algorithm is a "simple" branch-and-cut-and-price provided by Coluna.


coluna = optimizer_with_attributes(
    Coluna.Optimizer,
    "params" => Coluna.Params(
        solver = Coluna.Algorithm.TreeSearchAlgorithm() # default BCP
    ),
    "default_optimizer" => HiGHS.Optimizer # HiGHS for the master & the subproblems
);


# In BlockDecomposition, an axis is the index set of subproblems.
# Let `M` be the index set of machines; it defines an axis along which we can implement the
# desired decomposition. In this example, the axis `M` defines one knapsack subproblem for
# each machine.

# Jobs are not involved in the decomposition, you thus define the set `J` of jobs as a classic
# range.

@axis(M, 1:nb_machines);
J = 1:nb_jobs;

# The model takes the form :

model = BlockModel(coluna);
@variable(model, x[m in M, j in J], Bin);
@constraint(model, cov[j in J], sum(x[m, j] for m in M) >= 1);
@constraint(model, knp[m in M], sum(w[m, j] * x[m, j] for j in J) <= Q[m]);
@objective(model, Min, sum(c[m, j] * x[m, j] for m in M, j in J));

# You then apply a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition along the `M` axis:


@dantzig_wolfe_decomposition(model, decomposition, M)

# where `decomposition` is a variable that contains information about the decomposition.

# Once the decomposition is defined, you can retrieve the master and the subproblems to give
# additional information to the solver.


master = getmaster(decomposition)
subproblems = getsubproblems(decomposition)


# The multiplicity of a subproblem is the number of times that the same independent block
# shaped by the subproblem appears in the model. This multiplicy also specifies the number of
# solutions to the subproblem that can appear in the solution to the original problem.

# In this GAP instance, the upper multiplicity is $1$ because every subproblem is different,
# *i.e.*, every machine is different and used at most once.

# The lower multiplicity is $0$ because a machine may stay unused.
# The multiplicity specifications take the form:

specify!.(subproblems, lower_multiplicity = 0, upper_multiplicity = 1)
getsubproblems(decomposition)


# The model is now fully defined. To solve it, you need to call:

optimize!(model)


# Finally, you can retrieve the solution to the original formulation with JuMP methods.
# For example, if we want to know if the job 3 is assigned to machine 1 :

value(x[1,3])
