# Callbacks

Callbacks are functions defined by the user that allow him to take over part of the default 
algorithm. 
The more classical callbacks in a branch-and-price solver are:

- Pricing callback that takes over the procedure to determine whether the current master LP 
    solution is optimum or produces an entering variable with negative reduced cost
- Separation callback that takes over the procedure to determine whether the current master
    LP solution is feasible or produces a valid problem constraint that is violated
- Branching callback that takes over the procedure to determine whether the current master 
    LP solution is integer or produces a valid branching disjunctive constraint that rules out 
    the current fractional solution.

On this page, we use the following aliases : 
```julia
const BD = BlockDecomposition
const MOI = MathOptInterface
```

## Pricing callback

The pricing callback let you define how to solve the subproblems of a Dantzig-Wolfe 
decomposition to generate a new entering column in the master program. 
This callback is useful when you know an efficient algorithm to solve the subproblems, 
i.e. an algorithm better than solving the subproblem with a MIP solver.

Let us see an example with the generalized assignment problem for which the JuMP model takes the form:

```julia
model = BlockModel(optimizer)

@axis(M, 1:nb_machines)
J = 1:nb_jobs

# JuMP model
@variable(model, x[m in M, j in J], Bin)
@constraint(model, cov[j in J], sum(x[m,j] for m in M) == 1)
@objective(model, Min, sum(c[m,j]*x[m,j] for m in M, j in J))
@dantzig_wolfe_decomposition(model, dwdec, M)
```

where, as you can see, we omitted the knapsack constraints. 
These constraints are implicitly defined by the algorithm called in the pricing callback.

Assume we have the following method that solves efficiently a knapsack problem:

```julia
solve_knp(job_costs, lb_jobs, ub_jobs, capacity)
```
where 
- `job_costs` is an array that contains the cost of each job
- `lb_jobs` is an array where the $j$-th entry equals $1$ if it is mandatory to put job $j$ in the knapsack
- `ub_jobs` is an array where the $j$-th entry equals $0$ if job $j$ cannot be put in the knapsack
- `capacity` is a real that is equal to the capacity of the knapsack

The pricing callback is a function. It takes as argument `cbdata` which is a data structure
that allows the user to interact with the solver within the pricing callback.

```julia
function my_pricing_callback(cbdata)
    # Retrieve the index of the subproblem (it will be one of the values in M)
    cur_machine = BD.callback_spid(cbdata, model)

    # Retrieve reduced costs of subproblem variables
    red_costs = [BD.callback_reduced_cost(cbdata, x[cur_machine, j]) for j in J]

    # Retrieve current bounds of subproblem variables
    lb_x = [BD.callback_lb(cbdata, x[cur_machine, j]) for j in J]
    ub_x = [BD.callback_ub(cbdata, x[cur_machine, j]) for j in J]

    # Solve the knapsack with a custom algorithm
    jobs_assigned_to_cur_machine = solve_knp(red_costs, lb_x, ub_x, Q[cur_machine])

    # Create the solution (send only variables with non-zero values)
    sol_vars = [x[cur_machine, j] for j in jobs_assigned_to_cur_machine]
    sol_vals = [1.0 for j in jobs_assigned_to_cur_machine]
    sol_cost = sum(red_costs[j] for j in jobs_assigned_to_cur_machine)

    # Submit the solution to the subproblem to Coluna
    MOI.submit(model, BD.PricingSolution(cbdata), sol_cost, sol_vars, sol_vals)
    return
end
```

The pricing callback is provided to Coluna using the keyword `solver` in the method 
`specify!`.

```julia
master = BD.getmaster(dwdec)
subproblems = BD.getsubproblems(dwdec)
BD.specify!.(subproblems, lower_multiplicity = 0, solver = my_pricing_callback)
```

## Separation callbacks

Separation callbacks let you define how to separate cuts or constraints.

### Robust facultative & essential cuts (user cut & lazy constraint)

This callback allows you to add cuts to the master problem. 
[Example in the JuMP documentation](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/callbacks/#User-cuts-1).
